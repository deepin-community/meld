Application icons
=================

On *nix platforms we only ship SVG application icons: the regular Meld icon at
`hicolor/scalable/apps/org.gnome.Meld.svg`, the development version of the
icon `hicolor/scalable/apps/org.gnome.MeldDevel.svg`, and the symbolic icon
for GNOME shell presentation at
`hicolor/symbolic/apps/org.gnome.Meld-symbolic.svg`.

The Windows `ico` file in this folder is converted from the SVG source. See
the `Makefile` in this folder for the very simple command.
